                <p class="bio-text">
                    Hello, I am Rikiya Okawa. After returning to Japan, I worked at Costco Wholesale for about a year, then at AccorHotels for three years, and studied UI/UX Design at Digital Hollywood Tokyo until September 2022.

            <h2>More About Me</h2>
            <p class="iconSection">
                I graduated from Kanda Foreign Language Institute in November 2015 and from Grossmont College's Digital Arts program in June 2017. In September 2022, I completed my major in UI/UX Design at the Tokyo School of Digital Hollywood.
            </p>
            <p class="iconSection">
                In my previous role, I primarily engaged in language-related tasks. I handled guest check-ins and check-outs, reservation creation, telephone and email correspondence with overseas agents, and addressed complaints from international guests. This role significantly improved my communication skills and my ability to handle complex situations in a multilingual environment.
            </p>
            <p class="iconSection">
                Until September 2022, I interned at Tree Digital Studio Co., Ltd., where I focused on improving the logo and UI/UX of educational AR games. My contributions here were not just about design; I also learned about integrating user feedback into the development process. Until December 2022, I worked part-time at Little Planet Inc.'s AR/VR facility, where I mainly studied user experience and target demographics. This experience was invaluable in understanding the needs and preferences of diverse user groups.
            </p>
            <p class="iconSection">
                Currently, I am employed as a Web Engineer at Fivestar Interactive Inc. My primary responsibility involves creating websites. I work with HTML5, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript, utilizing Node JS as the runtime environment. This role has allowed me to hone my technical skills further and stay updated with the latest trends in web development. I am committed to creating responsive, user-friendly websites that not only meet but exceed client expectations.
            </p>
            <p class="iconSection">
                My journey through various roles has given me a broad perspective on the digital industry, and I am keen to leverage this experience in future projects that challenge me and allow for creative and innovative solutions.

                        For my graduation project, we created a VR game and interactive video using Unity and TouchDesigner based on the service improvement of an actual VR/AR facility. The VR game was created mainly using Unity and C#. The objects in the game were free objects from the Unity asset store. TouchDesigner was used to create a realistic environment. The game is interactive and reacts when the user actually touches the images. The production time for this game was about 1 week.

                        This is my graduation work in digital art, which I majored in during college. I was mainly in charge of sub-character design and video editing. For the theme of the animation, I read a poem chosen at random by the teacher and made it into an animation. I had a hard time communicating with the other members of the team in English, so I had a hard time conveying what I was thinking. With the support of the teachers and members, the animation was only one minute long, but it is a work that I am very attached it. Thanks to this work, I was selected as a high achiever in college. The production time was one month.
